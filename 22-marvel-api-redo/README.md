Let's step it up. Let's recreate the whole Marvel API assignment by building on what we did yesterday.

After completing this assignment, you should now:

* Feel confident with routing in Angular
* Understanding the basics of looping data

You should also be able to effectively use:

* `ng-repeat`

## What to Submit

1. A link to your GitHub repo containing your modified version of the boilerplate files.
2. Notes:
  * A link to the GitHub Pages URL for your repo.
  * Your confidence level for this assignment from 0 to 5. (0 is no confidence, 5 is master)
  * There are a lot of new files now. Does the separation of code into modules make it easier or harder to work with?
  * Did you complete at least "Explorer Mode"?
  * If no, briefly explain why not.
  * If yes, how far past Explorer did you get?  

## Explorer Mode

### Quest 1! Characters

1. Create a new project via Source Tree called `22-marvel-api-redo`. If you don't remember how, [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mp3LYUVKoKU).

2. In your `22-marvel-api-redo` directory run `startfrom tiy-lr-fee/assignments 22-marvel-api-redo` to download the boilerplate.

3. Open `app.js` and follow the directions inside to complete a few minor things.

4. Open `modules/characters/config.js` and follow the directions to setup routing for characters.

5. Open `modules/characters/controller.js` and follow the directions to setup your controller for the characters portion.

6. Open `modules/characters/character.html` and create your view to use the data. The end result should look like this:

  > NOTE! Remember that links in Angular use ui-sref

### Quest 2! Events

1. Open `modules/events/config.js` and follow the directions to setup routing for events.

2. Open `modules/events/controller.js` and follow the directions to setup your controller for the events portion.

3. Open `modules/events/event.html` and create your view to use the data. The end result should look like this:

  > NOTE! Remember that links in Angular use ui-sref

## Adventurer Mode

Convert Adventurer Mode from the original Marvel API. Make additional API calls as required to locate images for the characters on the Events page.
