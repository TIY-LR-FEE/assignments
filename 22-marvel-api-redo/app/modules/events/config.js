/*
  Event Module Configuration Function
  --------------------------

  This is where you pass in config time options to Providers.
  For example, this is where you can configure $stateProvider
  to set up your routing.

  STEP 1: Use $stateProvider.state to add a single route called
          characters that points to /events/:id

          It should use the EventsController and call it eventCtrl.

          It should use the ./event.html template. Don't forget,
          we use require() to include templates!
