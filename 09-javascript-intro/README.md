This assignment lets you get a feel for writing JavaScript and running it with node.

After completing this assignment, you should now:
* Be comfortable running JavaScript with node
* Be more comfortable using git on the command line

You should also be able to effectively use:
* types
* variables
* conditional statements
* for loops

## What to Submit
1. A link to your GitHub repo containing `index.js`
2. Notes:
  * Your confidence level for this assignment from 0 to 5. (0 is no confidence, 5 is master)
  * What's harder for you: the syntax required to write the JavaScript, or the actual procss of thinking what to write?

## Explorer Mode

1. Create a new project via the command line called `09-javascript-intro`. If you don't remember how, [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyEuodzR-yE).

2. Create an `index.js` file in your project.

3. Declare 5 variables, but don't assign them a value.

4. Declare 5 variables and assign them to numbers.

5. Declare 5 variables and assign them to strings.

6. Declare 5 variables and assign them to booleans.

7. Declare 2 variables and assign them to numbers. Then, on a separate line, declare another variable and assign it to the sum of the first two variables.

8. Declare a variable and assign it to a boolean. Then, write an `if` statement using that variable. If it's true, `console.log` out a statement that it's true. Then, add an `else` statement that `console.log`s out a statement that it's false.

9. Write a `for` loop. It should run until `i` is greater than 10. Each time it runs, it should `console.log` the current value of `i`.

## Adventurer Mode

1. Declare a variable and assign it the number 3. Then, write a `switch` statement that takes that variable as its parameter, and has a case for numbers 1 to 4. Each case should `console.log` the corresponding letter of the alphabet (1 = a, 2 = b). Declare a default case that `console.log`s a message that their number was not found.

2. Declare a variable and set its value to true. Write a `while` statement that takes that variable as its parameter. Make the `while` statement run 10 times, then change the value of the variable to false.

3. Declare 2 variables. Set one to the number 5 and the other to the number 6. Write an `if` statement that evaluates to `true` for each of the following comparisons: `!==`, `>`, `<`. Then write an `if` statement that evaluates to `false` for each of the following comparisons: `===`, `==`, `>`, `<`.

4. Declare a variable and set its value to `false`. Write an `if` statement that takes that value as its parameter and evaluates to `true`.
