# Basics of CSS Layout

CSS Layout is one of the most important things to learn early on. In this exercise, we're going to explore `float` layouts by recreating a simple page.

After completing this assignment, you should now:

* Understand `float` layouts
* Be able to place any element on a page where you want it.

You should also be able to effectively use:

* `display`
* `float`
* `clear`
* git & GitHub

## What to Submit

1. A link to your GitHub repo containing `index.html` and `main.css`.
2. Notes:
  * Your confidence level for this assignment from 0 to 5. (0 is no confidence, 5 is master)
  * What was the hardest thing for you to place where you wanted it?
  * Did you complete at least "Explorer Mode"?
  * If no, briefly explain why not.
  * If yes, how far past Explorer did you get?  

## Explorer Mode

### Quest 1! Tackling git

1. Download the following two files: [index.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TIY-LR-FEE/assignments/master/02-octocats/index.html) and [main.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TIY-LR-FEE/assignments/master/02-octocats/main.css). Place those files in a new directory (I recommend naming it 02-octocats). And yes, `main.css` is blank. Don't freak out.
3. Open iTerm2, navigate to the directory you just created, and make it a git repo by calling `git init .`, then use `hub create 02-octocats` to create a matching repo on your GitHub.
4. Add the downloaded files, commit them and push them to GitHub. Your message should express that the files you're pushing are the example, starter files.

### Quest 2! CSS Layout

Add CSS to `main.css` to make `index.html` look the same as this image:

Don't change `index.html`. You can do this entirely with CSS.

When you're complete, don't forget to commit your changes and push them to GitHub.

## Adventurer Mode

Often times, groups of HTML are repeated to achieve a particular effect. These are sometimes referred to as modules or components. In the case of this exercise, each Octocat is made up of very similar HTML.

Identify that HTML, then copy it to make 3 more Octocats. You can find additional Octocat images [here](https://octodex.github.com/).

Your end result should be two rows that look very similar to the example image from **Explorer Mode**.
