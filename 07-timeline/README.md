This assignment will help reinforce your knowledge of HTML layouts, as well as creating HTML components.

After completing this assignment, you should now:
* Be able to create a complex layout from scratch
* Be able to structure repeating code into reusable chunks of HTML

## What to Submit
1. A link to your GitHub repo containing:
  * `index.html`
  * a `styles` folder containing `main.css`
  * an `images` folder with any images you used in your design
2. Notes:
  * Your confidence level for this assignment from 0 to 5. (0 is no confidence, 5 is master)
  * Did you complete at least "Explorer Mode"?
  * If no, briefly explain why not.
  * If you completed **Adventurer Mode**, what issues did you run into turning your code into reusable chunks?

## Explorer Mode

1. Recreate the following layout in HTML and CSS:

2. Push your code to GitHub in a repo called 07-timeline.

## Adventurer Mode

Refactor your code to have a consistent structure for each item on the timeline. Try adding a couple new items. Can you do so by copying an existing element and changing the text, or do you need to write new custom classes for each new item? Componentize your code so you can make a new entry (including alternating colors) by just copying an existing entry and modifying the text.
