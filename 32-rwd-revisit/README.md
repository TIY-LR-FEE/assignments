It's been a while since we did anything with media queries. Let's revisit them to create a simple blog site that looks good on mobile devices, huge monitors and everything in between.

## What to Submit

1. A link to your GitHub repo containing your modified version of the boilerplate files.
2. Notes:
  * A link to the GitHub Pages URL for your repo.
  * Your confidence level for this assignment from 0 to 5. (0 is no confidence, 5 is master)
  * Did you complete at least "Explorer Mode"?
  * If no, briefly explain why not.
  * If yes, how far past Explorer did you get?  

## Explorer Mode

1. Create a new project via Source Tree called `32-rwd-revisit`. If you don't remember how, [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mp3LYUVKoKU).

2. In your `32-rwd-revisit` directory run `startfrom tiy-lr-fee/assignments 32-rwd-revisit` to download the boilerplate.

3. Build the following version of the site without using media queries. This is intended for phones, so you'll need to test in a very small browser window, or using Chrome's responsive tools on an iPhone device. It should look good for devices up to 649px.

4. Add media queries for a min-width of 650px to make the design look like the following. It should expand to fill the edges of the browser as best as possible.

5. Add media queries for a min-width of 1024px to make the design look like the following. It should have a fixed width at this point to prevent it from becoming too wide on large screens.

## Adventurer Mode

Let's use this as an excuse to get more practice with Google Maps. Add a map (using vanila JavaScript, not ng-map) into the blog post. Make the map shrink/grow appropriately with the rest of the design. Center it some place interesting and add a single marker.

## Epic Mode
