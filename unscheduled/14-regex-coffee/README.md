This assignment serves to reinforce the use of Regular Expressions in JavaScript.

After completing this assignment, you should now:

* Understand the basics of regular expressions
* Have a firm grasp on string manipulation

You should also be able to effectively use:

* `String.prototype.replace`
* `String.prototype.split`
* `String.prototype.match`
* `RegExp.prototype.test`

## What to Submit
1. A link to your GitHub repo containing your modified version of the boilerplate files.
2. Notes:
  * Your confidence level for this assignment from 0 to 5. (0 is no confidence, 5 is master)

## Explorer Mode

1. Create a new project via the command line called `14-regex-coffee`. If you don't remember how, [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyEuodzR-yE).

2. In your `14-regex-coffee` directory run `startfrom tiy-lr-fee/assignments 14-regex-coffee` to download the boilerplate.

3. Run `npm test`. You should see quite a number of tests fail.

4. Open `app.js` in Atom and implement each regular expression. You'll see a section labeled `YOUR CODE HERE` in each one. After you complete one, you should always re-run `npm test` to verify that it passes all of the tests. If a test fails, look at how it's calling your regular expression to determine whats wrong.

5. When running `npm test` returns only passing tests, push your final code to GitHub.
