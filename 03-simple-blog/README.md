# A Simple Blog

This assignment serves to reinforce HTML, CSS, working with Atom and some familiarity with the command line.

After completing this assignment, you should now:
* Be able to create a blog layout from scratch
* Be comfortable navigating in the terminal
* Be comfortable opening projects in Atom

You should also be able to effectively use:
* A significant number of HTML tags
* A significant number of CSS properties
* Placeholder resources like Lorem Ipsum

## What to Submit
1. A link to your GitHub repo containing:
  * `index.html`
  * a `styles` folder containing `main.css`
  * an `images` folder with any images you used in your design
2. Notes:
  * Your confidence level for this assignment from 0 to 5. (0 is no confidence, 5 is master)
  * What was it like finding your own images and text for this assignment?

## Explorer Mode

Recreate the following layout in HTML and CSS:

**You'll need to find your own placeholder images and text**. There are sites to help you find them listed down at the bottom.

Then create a repo called 03-simple-blog on GitHub and push your code to it.

## Adventurer Mode

Use **two different** state based pseudo selectors (`hover`, `active`, `visited`, `focus`, `checked`, et cetera). You could change the color of the button or links when you hover, or change something about the search box when they focus on it, for example. Be creative! Let the CSS out!

Use **two different** element searching pseudo selectors (`first-child`, `nth-child`, `last-child`, `first-of-type`). These may not be the best choices for your selectors on this exercise, but it will help you gain a mastery for when they *are* the best choice in the future.
