Let's build another Ionic app, but this time let's use tabs to create a multipage app.

## What to Submit

1. A link to your GitHub repo containing your modified version of the boilerplate files.
2. Notes:
  * A link to the GitHub Pages URL for your repo.
  * Your confidence level for this assignment from 0 to 5. (0 is no confidence, 5 is master)
  * Did you complete at least "Explorer Mode"?
  * If no, briefly explain why not.
  * If yes, how far past Explorer did you get?  

## Explorer Mode

1. Create a new project via Source Tree called `34-another-iphone-app`. If you don't remember how, [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mp3LYUVKoKU).

2. In your `34-another-iphone-app` directory run `startfrom https://github.com/jbarket/boilerplate-ionic.git` to download the boilerplate. **REMEMBER THAT YOU NEED TO RUN ionic serve INSTEAD OF GULP TO RUN THIS PROJECT**

9. Test it on the iOS simulator to make sure it looks right. Make sure you've run `cordova add platform ios` in your project directory, then run `ionic emulate ios` to test it out.
