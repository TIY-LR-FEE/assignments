This assignment demonstrates layout at a component level.

After completing this assignment, you should now:
* Understand the basics of test driven development
* Be comfortable running JavaScript on the command line with `node`

You should also be able to effectively use:
* types
* functions
* loops
* conditional statements

## What to Submit
1. A link to your GitHub repo containing `rovarspraket.js`
2. Notes:
  * Your confidence level for this assignment from 0 to 5. (0 is no confidence, 5 is master)
	* Which function was the hardest to complete? Was it the amount of unknown JavaScript that made it hard, or the logic required to complete the task?

## Explorer Mode

1. [Download the original roverspraket.js] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TIY-LR-FEE/assignments/master/10-rovarspraket/rovarspraket.js) and place it in your project directory.

2. Open the terminal, navigate to your project directory and run `node rovarspraket.js`. You should see quite a number of tests fail.

3. Open the file in Atom and implement each function. You'll see a section labeled `// YOUR CODE HERE` in each one. After you complete a function, you should always re-run `node rovarspraket.js` to verify that it passes all of the tests. If a test fails, look at how it's calling your function to determine what your function isn't handling.

4. When running `node rovarspraket.js` returns only passing tests, push your final code to a GitHub repo called 10-rovarspraket.

## Adventurer Mode

1. Add a new function called `min` that accepts two numbers and returns the smaller number. Use `console.assert` to write your own tests to determine if the function works.

2. Add a new function called `findMostVowels` that accepts a string and returns the word with the most vowels in the string. You should use your existing `isVowel` to determine if a character is a vowel. Use `console.assert` to write your own tests to determine if the function works.
