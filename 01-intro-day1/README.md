# HTML and CSS Introduction

Everyone has to ship code on day 1!

After completing this assignment, you should now:

* Understand the building blocks of web development
* Be comfortable with the general requirements for submitting assignments

You should also be able to effectively use:

* HTML
* CSS
* Codepen

## What to Submit
1. A link to your Codepen or git repo
2. Notes:
  * Your confidence level for this assignment from 0 to 5. (0 is no confidence, 5 is master)
  * Did you complete at least "Explorer Mode"?
  * If no, briefly explain why not.
  * If yes, how far past Explorer did you get?

## Explorer Mode

Create a Codepen that contains at least **10** distinct HTML tags, and **10** different CSS properties.

Your HTML should be valid, semantic, and go at least four levels deep.

Your CSS should be valid and use at least three complex selectors.

## Adventurer Mode

In addition to normal mode, take a look at [this Codepen](http://codepen.io/kylf/pen/OPmvew?editors=110). It's a reproduction of a real life HTML/CSS bug.

You'll notice the following:
* text starts getting bold for no reason
* some content is shifted over to the left

Make a fork of the Codepen (just hit the "Fork" button on the top) and fix the HTML bugs. Then, in addition to submitting your **Explorer Mode** Codepen, submit this Codepen in your notes.

## Epic Mode

To go above and beyond, demonstrate your new knowledge of git by taking your code from Codepen and putting it into its own HTML file:

1. Create an `index.html` file that contains standard HTML boilerplate (`html`, `head` and `body` tags) and place your code from **Explorer Mode** into the `body`.
2. Create a new repo on your GitHub account called 01-intro-day1, add your `index.html` file to it, commit and push your code.
3. Instead of submitting your Codepen link, submit the link to your repo. If you completed **Adventurer Mode** (and, if you're doing **Epic Mode**, you should have), make sure to still submit that Codepen in your notes.

> Note! A simple way to make sure this worked is to look at your repo on GitHub. You should be able to see the `index.html` file, click on it and see your contents.
