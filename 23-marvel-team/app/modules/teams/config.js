/*
  Teams Module Configuration Function
  --------------------------

  This is where you pass in config time options to Providers.
  For example, this is where you can configure $stateProvider
  to set up your routing.

  STEP 1: Use $stateProvider.state to add a single route called
          new_team that points to /teams/new

          It should use the TeamController and call it teamCtrl.

          It should use the ./view.html template. Don't forget,
          we use require() to include templates!
