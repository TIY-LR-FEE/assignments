# Quest 1 - Revisiting Car Makes and Models

Let's make this more realistic. In the Explorer mode version, you had to construct your data in a way that would track generation information for a specific model. Now, let's step that up.

Your models should know the make (Ford), the model (Mustang), the generation (2005-2014 5th Generation Mustang) the trim (GT) and the color options. Keep in mind that trim and color options change between generations. You should be trying to provide the maximum amount of information possible for each section so that if we wanted to present a page on the Mustang as a whole across all generations there would be _something_ to show the user.



# Quest 2 - Reddit Clone

You're making a Reddit clone. You need to keep track of subreddits, text posts, link posts, comments and karma. Karma needs to be modeled in a way where users can up/down vote posts and comments, and where you could easily get the total karma for a user for _only link posts_ and _all comments_. You'll need at least 4-6 models to accomplish this depending on whether or not you choose to use polymorphic relationships.
